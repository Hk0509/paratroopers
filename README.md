# [Paratrooper Prototype](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XITxzgcGnbYR8-uu6W9C4rLfeVT6cUti/view?usp=sharing)

## Description

This prototype is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Paratrooper. In Paratrooper, the player controls a turret at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down paratroopers and helicopters before the paratroopers reach the turret.

## Features

- **Player Control:** The player can move a turret horizontally along the bottom of the screen using arrow keys or touch controls.
- **Shooting:** The player can shoot bullets from the turret to destroy paratroopers.
- **Paratrooper Spawning:** Paratroopers spawn randomly from the Helicopter and descend towards the ground.
- **Scoring:** Points are awarded for each **Paratrooper** (+10) or **Copter** (+5) shot down, and punished (-1) for each missed shot. The game keeps track of the player's score.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when a paratrooper reaches the ground. The player's score is displayed, and the game can be restarted.

## Game Mechanics

- **Player Movement:** The player can move the turret left and right along the bottom of the screen to aim at descending paratroopers.
- **Shooting Mechanism:** The player can shoot bullets vertically upwards from the turret to hit descending paratroopers.
- **Paratrooper Behavior:** Paratroopers spawn randomly at the top of the screen and descend towards the ground at varying speeds. The player must shoot them down before they reach the ground to prevent them from landing.
- **Scoring System:** The player earns points for each paratrooper or copter shot down. The score increases with each successful hit.
- **Game Over Condition:** The game ends when a paratrooper successfully lands on the ground. The player's final score is displayed, and they have the option to restart the game.
